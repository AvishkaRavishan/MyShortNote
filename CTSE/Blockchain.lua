##
Key Elements:

Blocks: Each block represents a collection of data.
Chain: Blocks are linked together in a specific order, forming a chain.
Hash: Each block has a unique identifier called a hash, created by applying a cryptographic function to the block's data.
Links: Each block contains a reference to the hash of the previous block, creating a strong connection between blocks.
Nodes: Multiple copies of the chain exist in a decentralized network, represented by individual nodes.
Consensus: Nodes agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the chain through a consensus mechanism.
Security: Blocks are secured through cryptographic hashing, making it difficult to tamper with the data.
Transparency: The blockchain is visible to all participants, providing transparency and immutability.
Adding New Blocks: Validated transactions are added as new blocks to the chain, extending its length.
