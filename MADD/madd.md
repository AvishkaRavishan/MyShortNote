# MADD

MVC
• Apple’s recommended architectural pattern
• Model is where data resides. model objects, parsers, etc.
• View layer is the face of the app. Its classes are often reusable as they don’t contain any domain-specific logic. (Eg: UILabel is a view that presents text on the screen, and it’s reusable and extensible)
• Controller mediates between the view and the model
